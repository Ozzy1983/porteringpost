                            <h5 class="description">On Friday 20th June there was a gathering to celebrate the life of Clive George Wilmott.</h5>
                            <p class="news-text">
                                Many of his friends and family were in attendance and sharing fond memories
                                of and heartwarming stories about Clive. There was also a chance to add some 
                                of these memories and comments to a guest book which was great for people to 
                                be able to read through and see all the lives that Clive had touched. 
                                The family was also looking to raise funds for the Southmead Hospital Charity 
                                should anyone wish to donate in Clive‚Äôs memory. Rest in Peace Clive

                                and likely lasting approximately 9 weeks as per the last scanner overhaul. 
                                During this period, we will revert to the staffing arrangements we had previously, 
                                with Level 2 being the predominant base for the Porters. There may be some changes 
                                this time so stay alert for notices being posted explaining this. 
                                At current it seems that CT will run on Level 2 from 8am to 8pm again.

                                with regards to a possible memorial on site for Clive Wilmott. At time of publishing 
                                this has not yet been agreed upon, but we will notify everyone of the intended plan 
                                when something more concrete is decided, and a crowdfunder will begin for those wishing 
                                to donate or raise funds. This is intended to be a longer-term fundraiser so that 
                                we have more time to plan events such as bake sales, art sales or other activities 
                                aimed at raising enough donations to pay for a suitable memorial to Clive, 
                                and potentially open the scope for a memorial to all of our departed colleagues.

                                Further to previous reports on the restructuring of staffing the Trust is currently undertaking, 
                                the Imaging Department has now been told to recruit to all their vacant positions, 
                                and this includes the hours that had previously been held in reserve for bank and 
                                overtime. There is due to be 4 new full-time staff being selected soon, 
                                following interviews on 22nd July, and this will of course have an impact on the extra 
                                shifts that are available. Once fully staffed we will only be able to justify offering 
                                bank shifts to cover sickness or emergencies.

                            <p class="news-text">
                                Does your blood begin to boil, and your temperature rise when you observe violations 
                                of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO)? Well, you are not alone! 
                                Iain Oram is now our official Fire Warden and will be conducting spot inspections 
                                to ensure we remain up to code and safe while at work. Iain will also be looking 
                                to have a fire drill and practice event in the near future so that you will be able 
                                to inform yourself on the correct evacuation procedures in the event of a real fire.

                                If you have any concerns regarding fire safety at work, feel free to contact 
                                Iain directly, either in person or via his work email account.

                            <h4>Parking Plans in Action</h4>
                            <h5 class="description">In response to the ongoing parking problems faced by staff at the hospital there will now be a relaunch of the Travel Engagement Programme. </h5>
                            <p class="news-text">
                                This will be a series of events such as workshops and feedback sessions, along with surveys to gain as much information from staff about their
                                travel options to work and challenges they face in doing so. They will be looking to hear from as many people as they can to inform further 
                                changes and support staff with their commutes. They are also aiming to promote the use of more sustainable and greener options. 
                                Those staff with an existing permit will be able to retain this, however charges will begin to apply from October 2025. 
                                This is currently proposed to be 0.75% of your salary, this is approximately ¬£15 a month for someone on Band 2 working 37.5hrs a week. 
                                The first deduction will be from your payslip in October. If you would like to avoid the charges you must cancel your permit and should look to do so 
                                before the first payment date. As they are looking to base the plans on feedback from people employed at NBT, you should regularly check your work email 
                                for any updates or proposed amendments to any plans. You can also make your voice heard on this matter as well as put forward suggestions or 
                                concerns you may have. More information can be found on the Trust LINK pages and is updated regularly.

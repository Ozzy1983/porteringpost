                    <p>
                        With over 9,000 staff at NBT we represent a wide swathe of the population and 
                        all it’s myriad differences. One difference that is important to take note of when interacting 
                        with colleagues is neurodiversity. So, what does that even mean? 
                        Neurodiversity is the term used to describe people with a range of differences such as Autism, 
                        ADHD, Dyslexia and Dyspraxia among others. It’s estimated that roughly 1 in 7 people 
                        in the UK are on the autistic spectrum, that’s more than 15%. These are not always so clear 
                        cut either, with some people experiencing their characteristics only mildly, 
                        some never even being diagnosed at all.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also worth remembering that this is not an illness or condition that can be cured, instead 
                        it’s just another expression of the complex diversity of human beings and genetics. 
                        For those of us that are not considered Neurodivergent, you will often hear the term ‘Neurotypical’, 
                        this simply means that your brain processes information and allows you to function is the way that society 
                        typically expects. I’m sure we all know a few neurodivergent people and even some staff that may come under 
                        that banner. It is important that we remember that in some cases people with these conditions may need extra 
                        time or special adjustments to allow them space to process everything. We can also educate ourselves by completing 
                        the Oliver McGowan training on E-Learning and researching ways that we can support our friends and colleagues. 
                        The main takeaway from this is to respect each other’s differences and support each other where you can as 
                        we all have our different struggles. Some links to useful websites will be listed below:

                        <h4>ADHD</h4>
                        <p>
                            The symptoms of ADHD can generally be categorised in two ways, inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsiveness. <br>
                            ● The inattentiveness can be expressed in having a short attention span, finding it difficult to organise or follow tasks, or even being forgetful. <br>
                            ● Hyperactivity and impulsiveness can include fidgeting, impatience and a predisposition to take risks. <br>
                            While there are medications that can help, some people with ADHD will often struggle with reliability and concentration, this is why it can be helpful for them to have tasks broken down into clear steps and take frequent short breaks.

                        <h4>Autism</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is a condition that exists along a spectrum, this means many people can experience mild autism 
                            and never even be aware of it. It chiefly affects a persons ability to interact with the world around them and 
                            how they perceive things differently from non-autistic people. They can at times struggle with understanding 
                            subtle body language and tones of voice which can mean they don’t pick up on signals others may be giving. 
                            Some autistic people can also find sensory stimulation overwhelming and require the opportunity to take a step 
                            back and process things. We can help by explaining things clearly and with no ambiguity, and focussing on the 
                            strengths someone might have and provide positive feedback.
